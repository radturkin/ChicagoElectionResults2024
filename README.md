# ChicagoElectionResults2024
a mapping of how people voted in Chicago 2024, along with relationship of voter turnout to polling location accessibility.

This project is currently a work in progress but you can view the streamlit app and interact with the map [here](https://chicagoelectionmap.streamlit.app/)

Some noticeable items in the 50th Ward include unusual polling location clustering in conservative precincts with minimal polling locations available to rest of the ward. What do you notice in the data?

## Things currently being added or to be added:
- Voter turnout by precinct
- Thicker ward borders
- Neighborhood names
- Cleaner user interface and instructions
- Options to select specific data and Wards
- Data on Chicago School Board results
- Additional information and resources
- Finishing this readme
