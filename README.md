# ChicagoElectionResults2024
a mapping of how people voted in Chicago 2024, along with relationship of voter turnout to polling location accessibility.

This project is currently a work in progress but you can view the streamlit app and interact with the map [here](https://chicagoelectionmap.streamlit.app/)

## To use the app:

You can use the tool bar next to the map to make the map full screen and zoom in/out.
Hovering over precincts will show the election results data for that precinct.
The bold value on the hover box gives you the ward and precinct (for example: 50024 would be the 50th ward 24th precinct). This is being updated to a more intuitive marker.
The Black dots are polling locations, you can hover over those for the exact address of the polling location.

Some noticeable items in the 50th Ward include unusual polling location clustering in conservative precincts with minimal polling locations available to rest of the ward. What do you notice in the data?
